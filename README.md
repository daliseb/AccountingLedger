# Accounting Ledger Application (Dalis' Smoothie Shop)
The objective of this project, was to create an accounting application that helps the user store,organize and display transactions.

-it is important to identify the first step, "What do we need our application to do exactly?"
This, sets us up with a game plan, we can then start thinking on the steps that we need to achieve our requirements!

*** Above, I have added a picture of my Jira boards, Jira helped my tremendosly when it came to sorting things out, I am a visual learner so it was helpful to see all of my steps displayed out for me. The boards, as shown above are where you can put an overview of your steps.

*** Above, we have an image of the timeline, as I mentioned before, the boards in Jira gave me an overview of larger tasks while the timeline went into more detail.

*** What else do we need to properly game plan? Above, I have my set up, I have two screens and I was able to pull up all of my resources to be able to switch from each workbook back and forth! This way, I can use one of my screens soley for having intelliJ and Zoom pulled up. I have stated before that I am a visual learner so it is important to me that I can easily refer back to my workbooks and reference them when needed.

***I have added a way that I used ChatGPT for learning purposes (: , I used it to help generate my transactions for my imaginary smoothie shop, as you can see, I prompted Chat to give me a wide variety of dates that can be used when it is time to create my csv file!


<img width="450" height="450" alt="stuck on reading csv file" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aca3f4ee-d04d-47da-bf79-878b765af80d" />

***This was the first problem that I encountered, I understood that I needed to create a file reader and buffered reader to read the csv file that I had created, I attempted to do this but after some advice from my classmates, I figured that at the moment it was not the most important thing and decided to prioritize other things such as building my menus. 

<img width="450" height="450" alt="moving onto my main menu" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dbec2bbc-ad9d-4dd6-b90f-9968e5b74126" />

****I decided to move onto creating my main menu screen! After all, this is the home screen for our overall application, without this screen, the user cannot input options.

****After creating a switch/case for each of my options, I found it easier to input my method for reading the csv file, because NOW, I finally had a spot to put it and a place where it NEEDED to be called!

*****As you can see above, I had to create a brand new method to be able to pull the text from my csv AND add onto it. For example, when the options such as add deposit or add payment are selected, the user input can then go back into the csv file.

****A requirement for our capstone was to create a reports menu, within the ledger menu, that was able to filter out dates, such as month to date, previous month, year to date and previous year! I did some research on W3 schools, I used the java oracle website and a website called geeks for geeks that explained "Is After", "Is Before" and "Is Equal To" methods. This made it easier to understand and broke things down for me.

****Although this method was easier to understand, I still ran into trouble along the way, Here I am trouble shooting the issue and seeing if my prompts are pulling my files from csv correctly. As sho
